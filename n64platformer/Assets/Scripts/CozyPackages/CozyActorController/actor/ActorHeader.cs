            at the moment, I want to make sure our stepping algorithm is fairly efficient, considering
            how theoretically costly this algo can get

            simply raycast inward from the clipping plane and check below using the up dir

            we can simplify our query search for the following reasons:
            (1) steps are usually perpendicular to the primitive being cast, so if the angular difference/correspondance between
            the up vector and the surface normal are in completeley opposite dirs (n dot v) is approx -1, we have a flat surface.

            (2) since the surface is flat, we don't have to worry about our safety overlap colliding with the ground plane, so it's a
            simple case of detecting anything at a specified point above the plane

            capsules will usually work best for this type of stepping, but if your geometry is fairly simple, boxes are great too.

            I'm going to attempt to write a resolver that doesn't rely on any virtual calls/indirection to potentially aid
            performance.
